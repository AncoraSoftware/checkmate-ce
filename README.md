# Welcome to Checkmate!

This is a modified version of original Checkmate.


## About
Checkmate is a cross-language (meta-)tool for static code analysis, written in Python. Unlike other tools, it provides a global overview of the code quality in a project and aims to provide clear, actionable insights to the user.

### Keypoints

* Provides a global overview of code quality in a project
* Plays nicely with 3rd party libraries and checkers (e.g. pylint, pep8, jslint, etc.)
* Keeps analysis results in a document-oriented database and allows for fast querying
* Can be easily extended to new code checkers or version control systems by creating plugins
